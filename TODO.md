# TODO List for Adding "Current Analytics" Dropdown to Navbar

- [x] Edit `templates/base.html` to add a new dropdown named "Current Analytics" after the existing "Analytics" dropdown, containing links to "Current Cycletime" (/current-cycletime-data) and "Current FaultDelay" (/current-faultdelay-data).
- [x] Update the mobile menu in `templates/base.html` to include the new links under "Current Analytics".
